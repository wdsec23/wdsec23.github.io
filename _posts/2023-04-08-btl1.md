## Security Blue Team
I completed BTL1 in early 2021, while it was very new. Word was spreading around Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit about this exciting new certification that offered a practical exam. It immediately caught my interest, since defenders are starved for affordable, practical entry-level content. 
Breaking into security is hard, especially for newer analysts without IT experience. Many experienced technicians, and administrators often find it hard to break in as well. Credentials are cost prohibitive, and most employers will not pay for training unless it benefits one's current role.

## Target Audience
BTL1's content is incredibly accessible for entry level students. However, you **will not** pass the exam without the ability to practically use the skills taught in this course. It will require study, and practice. To date, it is one of my favorite certifications, simply because of the value it provides at its price point. For Â£399 (~$500) there's much to be gained for professionals, and newcomers alike.   

After completing the exam, you will have the skills required of an entry level analyst. I firmly believe this credential carries the weight needed to jump into a tier 1 SOC analyst role. It also is excellent for sysadmins, and network admins wishing to gain more knowledge around securing their infrastructure. I'm putting this cert in future job descriptions, and will be excited to find it on resumes.

## Training Content
The course content covers six domains:
+ Security Fundamentals
+ Phishing Analysis
+ Threat Intelligence
+ Digital Forensics
+ SIEM
+ Incident Response

The exam is a 24-hour practical incident response exercise. It will require a thorough understanding of each of these domains. However, there is nothing insanely difficult within the content, and what's provided is sufficient for the exam. Out of these I thoroughly enjoyed the Phishing Analysis section. I will cover this one in more detail.

### Phishing
Most people are taught how to spot a phishing email at a surface level. Poor grammar, weird context, and sketchy links are all basics anyone touching a computer should know how to analyze. However, phishing will continue to improve, and tactics will be developed to bypass filters. I think most professionals without proper training might have a hard time answering a user asking, "Is this safe?" Most will err on the side of caution, and recommend deletion if they are unsure. So how do you detect a phishing email if it's not glaringly obvious?

This section allows students to confidently answer that question. I never received training, or discovered much content on analyzing phishing email in my early career. I did a lot of googling, and trial & error to develop my own methodology. I felt confident in my abilities to analyze an email prior to the course, but learning this methodology early would have saved me some headaches. As a new analyst, being able to perform analysis on day one will put you miles ahead. This is also a great skill for smaller IT shops, without security staff. This is a perfect supplement to Exchange/O365 admins.

## Final Thoughts
I tore through the content pretty quickly; I was having fun. However, I already carried a good bit of experience walking into the course, and much of it was review. I absolutely had gaps in my knowledge, but I was able to target those fairly quickly. After two weeks I was excited, and anxious, so I attempted the exam right away. After about 6 hours I hit my limit, closed out the lab, and completed my report. I passed, but unfortunately did not score high enough for the Gold Challenge Coin reward. I missed a few key points in the exam; however, I covered the majority of what was required. 

I think this is the best value entry-level certification on the market. It was desperately needed at the time it came out. Passing the exam proves you understand the concepts presented, rather than memorizing content for a multiple-choice exam. I've recommended this certification to students, and junior professionals time, and time again. If you're on the fence, take it. It's worth it.
