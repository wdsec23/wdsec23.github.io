The CISSP is *the apex certification* in the security world, right?

The CISSP is widely recognized as being one of the top level certifications for information security professionals. It requires 5 years of experience in two of the 8 CISSP domains, minus one for a college degree. 

## Target Audience

Not everyone needs to be a CISSP. However, you'd be hard pressed to find it missing from job requirements, or preferred qualifications. There's no escaping it. The CISSP is not a deep certification, nor is it a very technical one. However, it covers a broad range of topics that require a decent understanding of to pass the exam. It is widely known by HR departments, and IT Leadership, but is often misunderstood. It's really not necessary for most, and serves as a tool for validating knowledge, rather than training a practitioner. Quite frankly, I pursued the CISSP just to say I have a CISSP. I just felt like I needed to get it finished. I certainly learned some new things while preparing for it, and it was absolutely a net positive. It exposes specialists to other important security domains they might not see in a silo. It provides understanding in the bigger picture of security operations. Would I recommend it to anyone in security? Yes. However, I don't think anyone should feel pressured to pursue it, unless it's a hard requirement for a job. When you sit for the exam, you should be well versed in most of the topics, *from experience.* I believe this cert really is really best suited for:

+ CIOs
+ CISOs
+ Security Directors 
+ IT Directors
+ Auditors
+ Compliance Officers
+ Senior/Principal Security Architects
+ Senior/Principal Security Engineers
+ Independent Consultants

Your average SOC analyst, or engineer shouldn't need to pursue it. Companies should also cut junior positions some slack, leave it off of job requirements.

## The Positives

Coming from a technical background, digging in to risk management really helped me out. I believe most of us technical folks need help with soft skills. That's not to say we aren't personable, or good communicators, but that we aren't equipped to discuss in terms of financial impact. That's how our executive teams speak. Risk management for IT folks rarely involves the financial impact, rather we concern ourselves with the technical impact. We're concerned with keeping systems up, but we're often not privy to conversations around income, and operational expense. Telling an executive we need to spend $250,000 to replace some EOL hardware, because we won't be able to upgrade past version 8.1.2.3 leaving us to RCE vulnerabilities is not effective. That's how we sound to non-technical staff.

We need to phrase the conversation differently. We need to spend $250,000, which will depreciate over 5 years, because we're protecting assets which generate $1M a month in revenue. That's an easy calculation. We're spending $50k a year to protect $12M. The CFO probably won't push back too hard at all. If they do, then we have another calculation. Should the hardware fail to protect these assets, we're looking at 7 days of downtime to recover. That's roughly $225k worth of lost revenue. We will also need to spend the original $250,000 on the hardware, which is hopefully in stock. If it has a two week lead time, we're losing even more money. Long story short, we've landed over 2x the cost of the original hardware quote should something go wrong. C-levels are way happier to sign your P.O. when you've answered all their questions before they have the opportunity to ask them. We're offering a value proposition, spend a little, save a lot. 

The inverse of this is that those who come from a non-technical, and regulatory background will gain better insight in the scope of technologies used to protect organizations. While you won't leave the exam ready to crank on a terminal, you'll have a better understanding of what goes into protecting an organization.

## The Negatives

Passing the cert says, "I know a little about a lot of things." There are 125-175 questions to validate your knowledge of 8 separate domains. You won't pass without understanding these domains, but it's hard to be an expert in all of them. I certainly don't have mastery over all 8 domains, nor do I plan to. While I'm glad I spent time learning, I absolutely dropped a chunk of knowledge once I passed the cert. If I had to sit the exam tomorrow, I might not pass. That problem isn't inherent to the CISSP. If you're not using something every day, you will lose it. It's a capstone cert, by the time you reach it, you should be well rounded enough to make educated guesses.

I did find the exam questions frustrating at times. You need to **read** the questions thoroughly, and understand exactly what they are asking. You're likely to get snagged over semantics if you're not paying extremely close attention. Sometimes I feel like they trying to hit you with a *gotcha*, rather than validate your knowledge. In all of my test prep, most of the questions I got wrong were because I missed a word in the question. There's a CISSP mindset you need to adopt when taking the exam. You're advising, you're not fixing. This absolutely helps when tackling questions in your weaker domains, and I believe it will carry you through most of the exam. 

## Final Thoughts

The CISSP is totally worth doing at some point in your career, especially after several years of experience. The closer in proximity you get to senior leadership, the better it is suited for you. It's not for everyone, and I wish it wasn't seen as the be-all end-all security cert. Despite my frustrations, I had an overall positive experience. Following the certification, I think it's wise to participate within (ISC)<sup>2</sup> community. I plan to join my local chapter at some point. It certainly doesn't hurt to make friends within this industry. I will be maintaining this cert as long as I'm working in the industry.
